<h2>Welcome</h2>

<img src="/images/photo.jpg" style="max-width:35%; float: right; margin: 10px;" />

<p>Welcome to my blog! I am an MPhil student at <a href="http://www.zju.edu.cn/">Zhejiang University</a> working with <a href="http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/zoubin">Zhihua Zhang</a>. Generally, I am interested in making machine learning algorithms do unique and useful things. More specifically, I'm presently developing 
scalable nonparametric Bayesian inference techniques. I also enjoy 
making machine learning tools that are simple to use</p>

<p>I've reproduced a list of recent posts here for your reading pleasure:</p>

<h2>Publications</h2>

<p>Below is a collection of publications and presentations from my undergraduate years. Feel free to email me with any questions, code requests, etc.</p>

<h2>Teaching</h2>

<p>Over the past few years, I've tutored a number of students, led discussions, created group honors projects, and structured a course in 
scientific programming. Please let me know if you are a student that was in one of my discussions, projects, or programming course, and you are 
asking the head faculty member to write a letter of recommendation for a scholarship, internship, etc. I am glad to send the faculty member additional information regarding our interactions, and if applicable, your honors project or extra work.</p>

<h2>Notes and Tutorials</h2>

		An interactive Bayesian nonparametrics bibliography -- currently requires javascript.
	</dd>
<dt>
	Compendium of Bayes Methods in Machine Learning<a href="/file/ML_Compendium.pdf">[pdf]</a>   
</dt>
	<dd>   
		In the past few months I've been slowly migrating the gist of my machine learning notes to a large compendium.  
	</dd>

	Programming Notes <a href="/prog_notes.html">[html]</a>

	<dd>   
		When learning new programming languages I like to compile my own ``quick references."

<h2>Code</h2>

<p>Note: I am in the process of writing readmes and documenting some of my larger pieces of analysis code and other programs I've written so that others can potentially use them. I tend to like dynamic (or agile) languages that allow me to concentrate on the problem I want to solve rather than the intricacies of things like variable typing and memory management.</p>

<h2>Code I find useful</h2>

After much testing this past summer, I found that this implementation 
consistently produces the correct LSP in the shortest amount of time for
 Matlab.
