<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>I am with solid foundations in Bayesian learning theory and image processing. I have a strong interest for building machine learning tools and have experience building them in MATLAB, Mathematica, python, java, C# and C++. I also have a strong Linux background. I am fluent in Chinese and English, both orally and in writing. I have interned in different companies, so I am confident in my teamwork and organizational skills.</p>
