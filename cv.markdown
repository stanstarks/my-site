## Summary

I am with solid foundations in Bayesian learning theory and image processing.
I have a strong interest for building machine learning tools and have experience
building them in MATLAB, Mathematica, python, java, C# and C++. I also have a
strong Linux background. I am fluent in Chinese and English, both orally and in
writing. I have interned in different companies, so I am confident in my teamwork
and organizational skills.

## Work experience

- In 2013 till now, I worked as a full-time intern at [ExaCloud], a startup cloud
  computing company. I am the only employee there dealing with image processing tasks.

- In 2012, I did a 3-month long full-time programming internship at
  [Microsoft Research Asia] Software Analysis Group. The job involved auto-
  diagnosing Sharepoint server issues according to system logs.
